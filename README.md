# Color-Picker
The Color Picker is an interactive web application that allows users to select a color from a predefined palette. Once a color is chosen, it will be displayed in a designated box along with its corresponding hexadecimal color code (e.g., #ffffff for white). This project is built using React with Vite and JavaScript,.
